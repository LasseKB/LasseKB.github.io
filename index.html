						Oust us a top-down, twin-stick, local multiplayer, social deduction game for four players.
						<br /><br />
						Players take control of agents of an oppressive government - the ODR.
						<br /><br />
						They are tasked with locating and burning illegal art and literature.
						<br /><br />
						However, one of the players is a western spy, trying to disrupt the operation. Will the ODR 
						prevail, or fall to the west?
						<br /><br />
						Responsibility: Implementing game mechanics.

						Grappler is a sidescroller where you have to get through caves as fast as possible using only 
						your trusty grappling hook.
						<br /><br />
						You must take care, however, to not swing too high and meet the sharp stalactites, or too low 
						and touch the searing lava.
						<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
						Responsibilities: Implementing the grappling hook, remixing sprites, and level design.

						<h2>Northern Hope</h2>
						<img src="NorthernHopeScreenshot.png" class="ItemVideo" width="384" />
						Northern Hope is a 3D walking simulator, played through the eyes of a patient in a wheelchair 
						who lives and relives events over a period of 14 years, experiencing a care center as it evolves 
						from a closed theraputic institution to an abandoned prison.
						<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
						Responsibilities: Implementing game mechanics and level white-boxing.
						<br /><br />
						Created by: Nikolaj Schildt Christensen, Jacob Hvid Amstrup, Adam Ryde Ankarfeldt, Mike Graham

						<h2>Master Thesis</h2>
						<h3>Ray Traced Reflections In Virtual Reality</h3>
						<img src="MasterThesisScreenshot.png" class="ItemVideo" width="384" />
						I did my thesis in a group of three people trying to implement ray traced reflections in virtual
						reality in a way that would be more performant than fully ray tracing all reflections. To this 
						end we expanded <a href="">Microsoft's "MiniEngine"</a> with virtual reality and implemented the
						following optimizations: Screen Space Reflections, Hybrid Screen Space Reflections, Temporal 
						Resolution Multiplexing, and Accelerated Stereo Rendering. Additionally, we extended Accelerated
						Stereo Rendering to better handle reflections.

						<h2>Hybrid Mono-Stereo Rendering for Virtual Reality</h2>
						<img src="MonoStereoScreenshot.png" class=ItemVideo width="384" />
						Hybrid Mono-Stereo Rendering for Virtual Reality is an optimization created by 
						<a href="https://www.lgdv.tf.fau.de/files/2019/07/HybridVR-reduced.pdf">Fink et al. in 
						2019</a>. The general idea of the optimization is to reduce the power needed to render for 
						virtual reality. To do this, instead of rendering the whole scene twice – one time for each 
						eye, as is the normal approach – only what is near the camera is rendered twice and objects 
						further from the camera are rendered once.
						<br /><br />
						In the "Graphics Programming" course at the IT-University of Copenhagen I chose to implement 
						this optimization in OpenGL.
