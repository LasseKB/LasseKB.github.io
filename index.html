						Oust us a top-down, twin-stick, local multiplayer, social deduction game for four players.
						<br /><br />
						Players take control of agents of an oppressive government - the ODR.
						<br /><br />
						They are tasked with locating and burning illegal art and literature.
						<br /><br />
						However, one of the players is a western spy, trying to disrupt the operation. Will the ODR prevail, or fall to the west?
						<br /><br />
						Responsibility: Implementing game mechanics.

						Grappler is a sidescroller where you have to get through caves as fast as possible using only your trusty grappling hook.
						<br /><br />
						You must take care, however, to not swing too high and meet the sharp stalactites, or too low and touch the searing lava.
						<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
						Responsibilities: Implementing the grappling hook, remixing sprites, and level design.
						<br /><br />
